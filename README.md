# Welcome

This is the standard macros respository for [sPHENIX collaboration](https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/). Following is the 10-min tutorial on using the sPHENIX macros from [this wiki link](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Tutorial/sPHENIX_simulation).

# Get started

Please follow [SPHENIX software day-1 checklist](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/SPHENIX_software_day-1_checklist) to get started.

# Check out macro repository

Download the newest macro repository from GitHub:

[jinhuang@rcas2073 g4simulations]$ # here is all the macros to run fsPHENIX and sPHENIX simulations
```

The default sPHENIX simulation + reconstruction macro is [Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX.C](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/WWW/sPHENIX/doxygen/html/d5/d2c/macros_2blob_2master_2macros_2g4simulations_2Fun4All__G4__sPHENIX_8C_source.html#l00001), which is self-explanatory. It is not a black box!. You are welcome to open/edit it to work for your purpose of study.

# Try an event display

Then let's see what is implemented by firing up one event:
```
[jinhuang@rcas2072 macros]$ source /opt/sphenix/core/bin/sphenix_setup.csh -n   # setup sPHENIX environment if not already done so
[jinhuang@rcas2072 macros]$ root
root [] .x Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX.C(-1) // here negative value in event number start an event display of one event
root [] .L DisplayOn.C 
root [] PHG4Reco* g4 = DisplayOn()
root [] Fun4AllServer *se = Fun4AllServer::instance();
root [] se->run(1)
root [] displaycmd() # this one show more Geant4 command we can run from the ROOT prompt
```

# Run more events

This is simpler, just run with first parameter as the intended number of event:
```
[jinhuang@rcas2072 macros]$ source /opt/sphenix/core/bin/sphenix_setup.csh -n   # setup sPHENIX environment if not already done so
[jinhuang@rcas2072 macros]$ root
root [] .x Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX.C(10) // run 10 events
```

# What next?

Now you are able to run the whole sPHENIX simulation + reconstruction chain. Many next-step topics are listed in the [software](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Software) page. And specifically, to use the simulation for your study, a few thing you might want to try:

* Checkout the [evaluator Ntuples](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Tracking) output from your 10 events for a generic look of the reconstructed data.
* [Write your analysis module for more dedicated analysis](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Example_of_using_DST_nodes), for which the module produced the evaluator NTuple ([CaloEvaluator](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/WWW/sPHENIX/doxygen/html/dd/d59/classCaloEvaluator.html), [JetEvaluator](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/WWW/sPHENIX/doxygen/html/d1/df4/classJetEvaluator.html), [SvtxEvaluator](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/WWW/sPHENIX/doxygen/html/d6/d11/classSvtxEvaluator.html)) can usually serve as good examples.
